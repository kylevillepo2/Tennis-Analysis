# Tennis Analysis project

In this project I train the YOLOv11 model to detect players and tennis balls on the court to make useful match analyses.
I first trained the YOLOv11 model on multiple roboflow datasets with the tennis ball annotated to make the model see the fast moving ball better. I also fine-tuned a resNet model to detect court keypoints.

## Datasets

This is the dataset for the courts keypoints: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lhAaeQCmk2y440PmagA0KmIVBIysVMwu/view?usp=drive_link
